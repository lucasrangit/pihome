Environmental monitoring for my house using a Raspberry Pi, two 
TI SensorTags and an Arduino with RedBearLab BLE Mini bluetooth radio.

While this project is currently far from being completed,
files INSTALL, ./Test/*.py and the sketches in ./Arduino 
might help as a starting point for your own experiments.
