Environmental monitoring for my house using a Raspberry Pi, 
two TI SensorTags and an Arduino together with a 
RedBearLab BLE Mini bluetooth radio.

While this project is currently far from being completed,
files './INSTALL', './Test/*.py' and the sketches in './Arduino' 
might help as a starting point for your own experiments.
(See esp. ./Test/ble_discover.py which provides a complete
characteristic discovery of a BLE device.)
